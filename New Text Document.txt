his Python program uses AES encryption to encrypt files and directories at the specified path using a given encryption key. The program can handle both individual files and directories, recursively encrypting all files within the directory. The output files are saved as binary files with a ".bin" extension. The encryption key must be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long, and any invalid keys or paths are handled with appropriate error messages.
